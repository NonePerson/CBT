# CBT

First, introduction:

In CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy),
a therapy which purpose is to improve mental health,
one core assumption is about the relationship between behaviours, thoughts and emotions.

According to this assumption,
Behaviour leads to thoughts, thoughts lead to emotions, emotions lead to another behaviour, and so on.

This is why in CBT, there's a concept of "analyzing situations" as part of the therapy.
In this concept, the patient thinks about situations where his behaviour disatisfies him,
and writes the thoughts, behaviours and feelings that arise in the situation - 

and then thinks about the thoughts, writes what he feels ABOUT his feelings in the situation
(That's called "meta-cognition" in psychology),
and how he thinks all of that is connected to his behaviour in the situation.

So this app helps you do that. You insert this information to whatever situation
you found yourself at and are disatisfied with how you tend to behave in it,
to help yourself change that behaviour with the "meta-cognition".

How to use it:

- Here's how to start the app:

From the folder you opened this file from,
open a few folders in the following orders:
"CBT" -> "bin" -> "debug"
Then, double-click on the file "CBT".

- Your computer needs to be able to load XML files somehow,
otherwise, the app won't work.

- Whatever the app says "Press {a key/any key} to.."

What it actually means is:

"Input {a key/any key} and then press ENTER, to.."

- There are instructions for every action possible in the app
at each point, IN the app, while you'll use it. Follow them.

- The information is stored mainly in text files (and in a XML file) - 
never, ever touch them. The app uses part of the texts to display the information
it needs to display at any point, as well as the XML file.

- There's no way to safefully remove any information right now.
Maybe I'll add it later.
